## Why Scrape Walmart?

Walmart is an e-commerce giant offering a vast range of products across categories. Scraping Walmart's product data has several key benefits:

- **Market Trends**: Track product prices and availability to understand market trends and demand.
- **User Reviews**: Extract customer feedback and ratings to perform sentiment analysis and gauge consumer opinions.
- **Time Efficiency**: Scraping data from thousands of listings is much faster and more accurate than manual collection.

By automating data collection from Walmart, businesses can make data-driven decisions and refine their strategies.

## Project Setup

To scrape Walmart, we'll use Python and the following libraries:

- [httpx](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/): An HTTP client library for making requests.
- [parsel](https://pypi.org/project/parsel/): An HTML parsing library for extracting data with XPath or CSS selectors.
- [loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/): A logging library for monitoring scraper performance.
- [asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/): A library for asynchronous programming to enhance scraping speed.

Install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install httpx parsel loguru
```

Alternatively, you can replace `httpx` with [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) or use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) as an alternative to `parsel`.

## Finding Walmart Products

### Using Sitemaps

Walmart's sitemaps provide a structured way to discover products. These sitemaps can be found in the [`robots.txt`](https://www.walmart.com/robots.txt) file. Here's an example:

```xml
Sitemap: https://www.walmart.com/sitemap_category.xml
Sitemap: https://www.walmart.com/sitemap_store_main.xml
```

The category sitemap allows filtering results by product categories:

```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://www.walmart.com/cp/trees/1388945</loc>
    <lastmod>2024-01-02</lastmod>
</url>
```

### Using Search Queries

Walmart's search system enables more refined filtering through URL parameters. For example:

```plaintext
https://www.walmart.com/search?q=laptop&sort=price_low&page=1
```

Hereâ€™s what the parameters mean:

- `q`: The search query (e.g., "laptop").
- `sort`: Sorting order (e.g., `price_low` for ascending by price).
- `page`: The page number to retrieve.

## Scraping Walmart Search Pages

Instead of parsing product data directly from the HTML, we'll extract hidden JSON data embedded within the page's JavaScript (`__NEXT_DATA__`).

### Parsing Search Results

Define a function to extract data from Walmart's search pages:

```python
from parsel import Selector
import json

def parse_search(html_text: str) -> dict:
    """Extract search results from Walmart search HTML response."""
    sel = Selector(text=html_text)
    data = sel.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
    data = json.loads(data)

    results = data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["searchResult"]["itemStacks"][0]["items"]
    total_results = data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["searchResult"]["itemStacks"][0]["count"]
    return results, total_results
```

This function locates the JSON data in the `__NEXT_DATA__` script tag, parses it, and extracts search results.

---

## Handling Walmart's Pagination Limit

Walmart limits search results to 25 pages (1,000 products). To scrape more data, split queries into smaller batches using filters like price range or categories. This approach allows retrieving a larger dataset without violating Walmart's restrictions.

---

## Scraping Walmart Product Pages

Each Walmart product page contains detailed information. Similar to search pages, much of the product data is embedded within a `script` tag in JSON format. Define a function to parse product data:

```python
def parse_product(html_text: str) -> dict:
    """Extract product details from Walmart product page HTML."""
    sel = Selector(text=html_text)
    data = sel.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
    data = json.loads(data)

    product = data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["data"]["product"]
    reviews = data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["data"]["reviews"]

    wanted_keys = ["availabilityStatus", "averageRating", "brand", "priceInfo", "name", "shortDescription"]
    product_data = {key: product[key] for key in wanted_keys if key in product}

    return {"product": product_data, "reviews": reviews}
```

This function retrieves essential product details like availability, ratings, price, and brand.

## Bypassing Walmart's Anti-Scraping Measures

Walmart employs robust anti-scraping mechanisms, including CAPTCHAs and IP blocking. To bypass these challenges, we recommend using [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons). ScraperAPI automatically handles:

- **CAPTCHA Solving**: Overcome challenges seamlessly.
- **IP Rotation**: Prevent blocks by using a pool of rotating proxies.
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Enable rendering for dynamic content.

Replace standard HTTP requests with ScraperAPI to ensure your scraper runs without interruption:

```python
from scrapfly import ScrapflyClient, ScrapeConfig

client = ScrapflyClient(key="YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY")

response = client.scrape(ScrapeConfig(
    url="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=laptop",
    render_js=True,  # Render JavaScript
    country="US",  # Use US-based proxies
))
```
