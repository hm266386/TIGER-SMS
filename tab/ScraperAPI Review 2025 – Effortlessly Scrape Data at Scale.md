## How to Implement ScraperAPI

ScraperAPI can be integrated into your program using different methods such as API Endpoints and Proxy Port SDK. Below is an example of implementing ScraperAPI in **Node.js** using the SDK method:

### Example Code: ScraperAPI in Node.js
```javascript
const ScraperAPI = require('scraperapi-sdk');
const apiKey = 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const scraper = new ScraperAPI(apiKey);

async function scrapeWebsiteContent(url) {
  try {
    let response = await scraper.get(url);
    console.log('Response data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error scraping website:', error);
  }
}

let url = 'https://google.com'; // Replace with the URL you want to scrape
scrapeWebsiteContent(url);
```

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import ScraperAPI SDK**: The `scraperapi-sdk` is imported.
2. **API Key Setup**: Replace `YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY` with the key you receive after registration.
3. **Initialize ScraperAPI**: Create a client instance using the API key.
4. **Async Function**: Define an asynchronous function `scrapeWebsiteContent` to handle the scraping process.
5. **Error Handling**: Use a `try-catch` block to manage errors.
6. **Log Response**: Display the response data in the console.

To use the code above, install the ScraperAPI SDK by running:
```bash
npm install scraperapi-sdk
```
