## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Install Python and Necessary Libraries
Download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and use pip to install the following libraries:
```bash
pip install crawlbase beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Isolate your project dependencies with a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv walmart-venv
source walmart-venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
walmart-venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 3. Get Your ScraperAPI Token
Sign up for a ScraperAPI account and obtain your API token from your [dashboard](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons).

## Understanding Walmart's Search Page Structure

Before we dive into coding, itâ€™s crucial to understand the layout of Walmartâ€™s search pages:
1. **Search Bar**: Located at the top, enabling users to input search queries.
2. **Search Results Grid**: Displays a grid of product listings with titles, prices, and ratings.
3. **Pagination Controls**: Allows navigation through multiple result pages.
4. **Product Cards**: Each product card contains essential details like title, price, and ratings.

Use browser developer tools (right-click and select "Inspect") to analyze the HTML structure and identify CSS selectors for the elements you wish to scrape.

## Building Your Walmart Scraper

### Step 1: Initialize the Crawlbase API
```python
from crawlbase import CrawlingAPI

api = CrawlingAPI({'token': 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_TOKEN'})
```

### Step 2: Scrape Walmart's Search Pages
Hereâ€™s how to extract product titles, prices, and ratings:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_page(url):
    response = api.get(url)
    if response['status_code'] == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response['body'], 'html.parser')
        product_containers = soup.select('div.search-result-gridview-item')
        products = []
        for container in product_containers:
            title = container.select_one('a.product-title-link').text.strip()
            price = container.select_one('span.price-group').text.strip()
            rating = container.select_one('span.stars-reviews-count').text.strip() if container.select_one('span.stars-reviews-count') else "N/A"
            products.append({'title': title, 'price': price, 'rating': rating})
        return products
    return []
```

### Step 3: Handle Pagination
To scrape multiple pages:
```python
def get_total_pages(url):
    response = api.get(url)
    if response['status_code'] == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response['body'], 'html.parser')
        total_pages = soup.select_one('nav.pagination span.total-pages').text
        return int(total_pages)
    return 1

def scrape_all_pages(base_url):
    total_pages = get_total_pages(base_url)
    all_products = []
    for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
        url = f"{base_url}&page={page}"
        products = scrape_page(url)
        all_products.extend(products)
    return all_products
```

## Storing Scraped Data

### 1. Save Data to a CSV File
Use Pandas to organize and save data:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = scrape_all_pages("https://www.walmart.com/search?q=iphone")
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv("walmart_products.csv", index=False)
```

### 2. Save Data to a SQLite Database
For structured storage:
```python
import sqlite3

def save_to_database(data):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("walmart_products.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            title TEXT,
            price TEXT,
            rating TEXT
        )
    """)
    for product in data:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO products (title, price, rating) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (product['title'], product['price'], product['rating']))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

data = scrape_all_pages("https://www.walmart.com/search?q=iphone")
save_to_database(data)
```
