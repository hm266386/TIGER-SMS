## How to Scrape Google News with Python

Follow this step-by-step tutorial to build a web scraper for Google News using Python.

### 1. Choosing the Optimal Approach

Scraping Google News can be tricky due to its complex HTML structure. Tools like [Playwright](https://scrapingant.com/blog/playwright-vs-selenium) or Selenium can help, but a more efficient approach is to use [RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Google News provides RSS feeds, offering a standardized way to access news content.

Hereâ€™s how an RSS feed typically looks:

![RSS Feed Example](https://scrapingant.com/blog/assets/images/scrape-google-news-screenshot-rss-xml-489741b816baaa8b4b76eed7a8c36220.png)

The XML format simplifies data extraction, making RSS feeds an ideal choice for reliable scraping.

### 2. Setting Up Your Environment

Start by creating a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the required libraries for working with RSS feeds:

```bash
pip install feedparser
```

### 3. Finding the Google News RSS Feed URL

To scrape Google News using RSS:

1. Navigate to a Google News category (e.g., Technology).
2. Add `/rss` to the URL (e.g., `https://news.google.com/rss?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en`).
3. Access the RSS feed in XML format.

![RSS Feed Example](https://scrapingant.com/blog/assets/images/scrape-google-news-screenshot-rss-feed-04f37ab0209bd07ba2961ebcfb30521b.png)

### 4. Parsing the RSS Feed

Use Pythonâ€™s `feedparser` library to download and parse the RSS feed data:

```python
import feedparser

url = "https://news.google.com/rss?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
feed = feedparser.parse(url)

for entry in feed.entries:
    print(entry.title, entry.link)
```

This outputs structured data, including titles, links, and publication dates.

### 5. Extracting Specific Information

RSS feeds store article details under `<item>` tags. Extract titles, links, publication dates, and sources:

```python
for entry in feed.entries:
    print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Link: {entry.link}")
    print(f"Published: {entry.published}")
```

### 6. Scraping News for Multiple Search Terms

To scrape news for multiple keywords, update your script to accept a list of search terms:

```python
search_terms = ["meta llama 3.2", "chatgpt o1 model"]
for term in search_terms:
    url = f"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={term.replace(' ', '%20')}"
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    for entry in feed.entries[:3]:  # Limit to 3 articles per term
        print(entry.title, entry.link)
```

### 7. Cleaning the Data

Make the data more readable:

- **Clean Headlines:** Remove extra text (e.g., source names).  
- **Shorten URLs:** Use libraries like [`pyshorteners`](https://pypi.org/project/pyshorteners/).  
- **Separate Source Information:** Extract and display source names separately.

### 8. Exporting Data to CSV

Export the cleaned data to a CSV file for easy access:

```python
import csv

with open("news_data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Title", "Link", "Published"])
    for entry in feed.entries:
        writer.writerow([entry.title, entry.link, entry.published])
```

## Does Google News Have an API?

No, Google News doesnâ€™t provide a native API. To programmatically access Google News data, youâ€™ll need third-party APIs like ScraperAPI.

## Challenges and Considerations

Scraping Google News presents challenges, including detection and blocking by Googleâ€™s servers. To overcome this:

- Rotate IPs.  
- Add random delays.  
- Mimic user behavior.

Alternatively, use **ScraperAPI** to handle these complexities automatically. It manages IP rotation, delays, and browser emulation so you can focus on data extraction.
