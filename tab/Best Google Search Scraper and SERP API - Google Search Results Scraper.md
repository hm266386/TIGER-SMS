## What is a Google Scraper?

A Google SERP scraper is a tool or software designed to extract data from Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs). This includes titles, URLs, descriptions, and additional elements such as featured snippets, ads, and related searches.

### Why Do We Scrape Google Search Results?

Google indexes the vast majority of public web pages, providing a rich dataset for market trend analysis, consumer behavior insights, and large-scale research. Scraping Google search results allows businesses to:

- Identify keywords competitors rank for.
- Evaluate their own ranking performance.
- Optimize content strategies to improve visibility.

Moreover, scraping Google's snippet systems, like the Knowledge Graph and Featured Snippets, enables quick access to structured information, saving time on manual data extraction.
